![Project Icon](./hate-crime.png) <!-- Replace with correct path or GitLab-hosted image URL -->

## 📊 Overview

This project focuses on mining patterns from a dataset of hate crimes in the United States between 2017 and 2025. By applying advanced data mining and machine learning techniques, it aims to uncover trends, classify incidents, cluster similar crimes, and extract meaningful associations to support public safety awareness and policy-making.
