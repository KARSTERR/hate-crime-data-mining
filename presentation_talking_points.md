# Hate Crime Data Mining (2017-2025) - Presentation Talking Points

## Introduction (1-2 minutes)

- Welcome the audience and introduce yourself
- Explain the objective of the study: analyzing patterns in hate crimes from 2017-2025
- Highlight the importance of understanding hate crime patterns for policy development and prevention

## Dataset Overview (1 minute)

- Source of the data and time span covered (2017-2025)
- Key variables: dates, locations, bias types, offense types, demographics
- Data preparation challenges and solutions

## Exploratory Findings (3-4 minutes)

- **Most Common Bias Types**: Anti-Black/African American, Anti-Gay (Male), and Anti-Jewish
  - _Reference_: Bar chart visualization showing top 10 bias types
- **Temporal Trends**: Show and discuss the interactive time series plot
  - Point out any notable increases/decreases or patterns over time
  - Highlight seasonal patterns discovered in the seasonal decomposition
- **Offense Patterns**: Reference the heatmap showing relationship between bias and offense types
  - Explain the strongest associations found

## Advanced Analytics (5-6 minutes)

- **Clustering Analysis**:
  - Explain the process of finding optimal number of clusters (elbow method)
  - Discuss the 3D PCA visualization of clusters
  - Highlight key characteristics of each cluster and what they reveal
- **Classification Models**:
  - Explain the approach: predicting racial bias based on other features
  - Discuss model performance (accuracy, precision, recall)
  - Highlight most important features in prediction
- **Association Rule Mining**:

  - Explain what association rules reveal about relationships in the data
  - Highlight 2-3 most significant rules discovered
  - Discuss practical implications of these associations

- **Network Analysis**:
  - Explain the network visualization showing relationships between bias types and offenses
  - Discuss centrality metrics and what they reveal about key nodes

## Statistical Validation (2 minutes)

- Discuss results of the Chi-square test for bias and offense relationships
- Present ANOVA findings on victim counts across bias types
- Emphasize the statistical significance of observed patterns

## Geospatial Insights (2 minutes)

- Point out any notable hotspots or regional patterns
- Discuss potential applications for resource allocation

## Interactive Dashboard Demo (1-2 minutes)

- Briefly demonstrate the interactive dashboard
- Show how different panels work together to provide comprehensive insights
- Highlight how this can be used by stakeholders for ongoing monitoring

## Key Recommendations (2 minutes)

- Based on temporal patterns: When to increase preventive measures
- Based on geographic insights: Where to focus community outreach efforts
- Based on association rules: How to tailor intervention strategies for specific contexts
- Based on predictive models: How to identify potential hate crimes early

## Conclusion & Q&A (2-3 minutes)
